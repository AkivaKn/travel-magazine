        Asia is the world's largest continent by land area and population, home
        to 4.4 billion people, more than half of the world's population.
      </p>
      <p>
        The continent is too massive and diverse to conceptualize as a single
        digestible travel "destination". Travel options range widely, from the
        desert ruins and modern mega-malls of the Middle East to the magnificent
        ancient monuments and giant mountains in South Asia, from the beach
        bungalows and jungle treks of Southeast Asia to the mega-cities and
        technology capitals of East Asia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Asia gets a tremendous number of travellers, both for tourism and
        business. Many of the world's most-visited cities are in Asia, including
        Bangkok, Beijing, Dubai, Hong Kong, Jerusalem, Mumbai, Seoul, Singapore,
        and Tokyo.
      </p>
      <p>
        Asia offers intriguing destinations for every type of traveller, be they
        a novice or an experienced road-warrior. Easier options include modern,
        prosperous countries like Japan and the East Asian Tigers of Singapore,
        Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea, where people enjoy very high
        standards of living.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are also poor Asian countries with significant levels of
        malnutrition, such as Cambodia, Afghanistan, Laos, and East Timor. Some
        countries are well-established on the budget tourist trail, including
        Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are countries that strictly restrict tourism to certain regions or
        types of tourism, such as Bhutan and the Maldives. North Korea and
        Turkmenistan, easily the world's most isolated and repressive states,
        take it even further, with constantly-watched group tours dedicated to
        their "great leaders".

          <h5>Angkor Archaeological Park</h5>
          <p>
            Stretching over 400 km2, including forested area, Angkor
            Archaeological Park contains the magnificent remains of several
            capitals of the Khmer Empire of the 9th to the 15th centuries,
            including the largest pre-industrial city in the world. The most
            famous are the Temple of Angkor Wat and, at Angkor Thom, the Bayon
            Temple with its countless sculptural decorations.

          <h5>Bali</h5>
          <p>
            Bali, the famed "Island of the Gods", is the most visited part of
            Indonesia. Its diverse landscape of mountainous terrain, rugged
            coastlines and sandy beaches, lush rice terraces and barren volcanic
            hillsides provide a picturesque backdrop to its colourful, spiritual
            and unique culture. Five rice terraces and their water temples have
            been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage Site under the name
            "Cultural Landscape of Bali Province: the Subak System as a
            Manifestation of the Tri Hita Karana Philosophy".

            ft). It straddles the border of China / Tibet and Nepal and can be
            visited from either side:
